                        new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

                        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. 
                        Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
                         show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
                          television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones 
                          that became nothing.
